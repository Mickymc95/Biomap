1. Install Node.js and npm
https://nodejs.org/en/
Ensure to check under "add to PATH" that both "Node.js and npm" and "npm modules" are set to "entire feature will be installed on local hard drive"

2. Install ionic
open Node.js command prompt
enter command - 
  "npm install -g ionic"
This will install ionic 

3. Change directory to the Biomap once ionic is installed 
enter command - 
  "npm install" 
This will take a while to install the applications packages.

4. Once the application is installed use the command -
  "ionic serve" 
This will serve the appliction on the browser

 Alternative emulator, use command-
  "ionic lab" 
 will emulate the application for mobile platforms in the browser.

Click on the location button on the top left of the map, this needs to be done to force the map to load the layers, this only needs to be done in the emulators, 
as the appllication works fine on an android device.
