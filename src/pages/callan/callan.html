          In 2014 to enhance biodiversity the grounds department established a small wildflower meadow outside the south entrance to the Callan Building to encourage bees, butterflies and insects. This was the first step in creating a more educational and interactive natural environment around the Callan Building. The wildflower meadow bloomed well in 2014 but by 2016 quite a number of the planted species had failed and the small plot was dominated by just a few species.

          In 2016 a section of the grassed area outside the Callan Building (section 1) was allowed to grow without mowing from April to October as a “don’t mow, let it grow” wildflower meadow. This approach allows plants that are present in the seed bank in the soil to grow, flower and set seed. During the first season a wide range of species flowered in the meadow and these in turn attracted a wide range of insects including bumblebees, solitary bees, hoverflies and butterflies. Although there was no regular recording of species in the meadow it was apparent that there was a varied collection of wildflowers present including clovers, buttercups, dandelions, daisies and 1 species of native orchid, the Common Spotted Orchid (Dactylorhiza fuchsii ssp. Fuchsia),  as well as many different species of grasses.

          In 2017 the “don’t mow, let it grow” approach was extended to include sections along the side of the Callan Building (sections 2 & 4) and a section between the Callan Building and the perimeter road (section 3). The plants growing in the wildflower meadow were recorded every two weeks between April and August. During that period 30 different species of wildflower were recorded, including the Common Spotted Orchid (Dactylorhiza fuchsii ssp. Fuchsia) and the bee orchid (Ophrys apifera), a scarce and occasional native orchid. A range of insects were also recorded, including 7 bumblebees species, 2 butterfly species, 2 moth species, 2 beetle species and 4 other insect species.

          In 2018 a new section of “don’t mow, let it grow” has been added (section 5) and plant and insect recording restarted in April.
